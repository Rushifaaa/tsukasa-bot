## About the Project
Hey.. I just wanted to make a Discord Bot so I just learned typescript in my teaching about a month ago, so I thought why not use typescript.  
It should be a simple Discord Bot that is Open Source under the [GPL-3.0](./LICENSE) so you can use it, but please read the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) first.


## Why "Tsukasa"?
Because I like the name :P

## Getting Started

**NEED TO KNOW**  
*You need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)!*
*Please install **ffmpeg** too please!*

So if you decided to host your own Bot you need a Bot Token **-I assume you know how to get it, if not google it or duck it :P**

At first clone this repository.  
`git clone https://github.com/Rushifaaa/tsukasa-bot`

After that just go into the Directory.  
`cd tsukasa-bot`

Now you can choose if you want the stable version or the development version.  
You are on default in the `master` branch -> **Stable Version**  
`git checkout develop` -> **Development verison**  

Now if you decided what version you want, you just need to type `yarn` to install all dependencies.
after that you can choose if you want to run it with `nodemon` (`yarn start-nodemon`) or with `ts-node` (`yarn start-tsnode`).  

If you are starting for the first time it will run and create a `config.json`, after that it will shutdown so you need to enter your token into the `config.json`.

If you try to run it one more time it will start :D

Have fun!

ps. you need to invite your bot on your server! (google it :P)
No worry i will make a Wiki where I explain it in detail - currently no time -
